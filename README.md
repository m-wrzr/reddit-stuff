### dnd
checking the number of art submissions in r/dnd. Conclusion: inconclusive. The "score" provided by the API is not useful and it's the main driver for visibility. The number of Art submissions increased, but similar to the overall rising numbers. The number of comments weighting method probably does not reflect the visibility of Art submissions. Reliable score would be required.
